Hi, I'm Nils. I grew up in Germany and studied Molecular Biotechnology at Heidelberg University. After finishing my master's degree, I moved to Stockholm to join the AICell Lab for my PhD.

During my studies, I combined laboratory work experience with computational biology. My masterâ€™s program covered a mix of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biophysics, which eventually led me to specialize in deep neural networks and multi-omics.

Alongside my studies, I worked as a bioinformatician in Heidelberg University's metabolomics core facility, MCTP. There, I got to dive into data analysis and visualization. In my master's thesis, I then developed an AI-based tool enabling the translation between transcriptomic and epigenomic data.

I'm passionate about the intersection of AI and cell biology. At AICell Lab, I aim to use data-driven approaches to unravel the complexities of biology. My research is all about contributing to our understanding of biological systems, with a special focus on advancing whole-cell modeling.
