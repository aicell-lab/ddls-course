Hello, I'm Songtao Cheng, a PhD student at the AICell Lab, specializing in the Department of Applied Physics at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

My current research revolves around the innovative design and implementation of an automated imaging farm. This groundbreaking project encompasses various aspects such as cell culture, passage, imaging, and more. Furthermore, I am actively engaged in the development of AI models tailored for real-time image analysis and whole-cell modeling.

### Background

After successfully passing the college entrance examination, I gained admission to Huazhong Agricultural University's bioinformatics program. I participated in iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) where I spent two enriching years collaborating with my teammates. This experience not only honed my scientific research skills but also nurtured a proactive spirit of exploration and self-discovery.

During my Master's at the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, I began to perceive the immense promise of combining automation and AI technology in the field of biological research. With the guidance and support of my supervisor, I embarked on research in this area, ultimately leading me to the AICell Lab.
