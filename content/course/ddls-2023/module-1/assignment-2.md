This week you will map out data-driven life science research. Your aim is to find and describe a peer-reviewed paper that fall under the umbrella of data-driven life sciences (review [module material](../) for a description) and a database that openly shares data that can be recycled in future research. In addition to the pdf you are asked to upload [here](https://forms.gle/HysGc7Aav2X8eLRt5), you will be asked to give a very short presentation (max 4 minutes) of the outcome of your research to the rest of the class.

Here is what this pdf should contain, in the form of bullet points (no need to write a long text!)
-   Your name and email address
-   For the paper
    -   write down the references
    -   explain what the aim of the paper was
    -   write down what data was used (collected or recycled)
    -   write down what analysis method(s) was(were) used
    -   Report on whether the data and the code for analysis is shared openly or how one would access it
-   For the database
    -   write down the url
    -   describe briefly what data is gathered
    -   describe the use of the database
    -   describe whether it appears to adhere to [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (see also this [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)).
