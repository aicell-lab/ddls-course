Lecture by [Juliette Griffié (DDLS Fellow)](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/Juliette-griffie)

In this lecture, we will focus on data sets obtained with super resolution microscopy, specifically spatial point patterns. We will study a range of analytical tools designed to extract fundamental information (e.g., structure) from these images. We will further explore how such approaches can provide a unique insight into the molecular spatial temporal requirements for cell signalling.
