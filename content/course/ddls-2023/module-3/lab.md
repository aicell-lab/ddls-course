For the computer lab, you will be given a Jupyter notebook about spatial point pattern analysis.

We will cover Ripleyâ€™s K curve testing, [DBSCAN](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3001460.3001507) and [SR-Tesseler](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3579), a notebook will be made available on the day of the lab.

Here are the references:
 - [Ripley K demo notebook](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos/blob/master/Ripley_K_demo.ipynb)
 - [DBSCAN demo in scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.html)
 - [SR-Tesseler: a method to segment and quantify localization-based super-resolution microscopy data](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3579)

## Colab Notebook Exercises

The notebook will be made available when we start the computer lab.

After you have completed the exercises in the notebook: 
 - During the lab session, tell the lab teacher so he/she can go through what you have done together and maybe ask you a few questions. 
 - Export the notebook in Google Colab by using `File -> Download -> Download .ipynb`, then submit the notebook file to the [submission form](https://forms.gle/gK3b1z2Sca2VYmcW7).


**Computer Lab Submission Deadline: Before Wednesday at 18:00 CET**


**NOTE: If you cannot join the lab session, please submit the notebook before the deadline, and find the lab teacher in a next lab session to go through what you have done together.**

**NOTE: For the seminar on Friday, please read the paper and submit the anwsers to the question sheet before the seminar, see [here](../seminar) for more details.**
