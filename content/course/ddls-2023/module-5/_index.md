This week, we will have two lectures on Tuesday, September 26th at 8:00-10:00.

## Lecture 1: Multi-omics Data Analysis

**Time: 8:00-9:00**

[Wen Zhong (DDLS Fellow)](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/wen-zhong/), Linköpings Universitet, Sweden

The integration of multi-omics data in health and diseases is revolutionizing our understanding of complex biological systems and accelerating the advancement of precision medicine. By combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics layers, researchers can identify intricate relationships and pathways that inform personalized treatment strategies. These data-driven approaches are facilitated by advanced computational algorithms and AI technologies, promising more accurate diagnoses and effective interventions for improved patient care.

## Lecture 2: BioImage Analysis and Deep Learning

**Time: 9:00-10:00**

[Estibaliz Gómez de Mariscal (PhD)](https://esgomezm.github.io/), Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Portugal

In recent years, advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated the growing power of these technologies in analyzing even the most complex image content. Deep learning has been successfully applied in analysing microscopy images of cells. In this module, we will walk through commonly used deep neural networks, training techniques, as well as pre- and post-processing methods for building deep learning based cell image analysis workflows.


## Computer lab

The computer lab will be made based on Lecutre 2 about bioimage analysis.
