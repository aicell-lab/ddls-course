Lecture by [Darko Mitrovic (PhD)](/author/darko-mitrovic/) on 3rd Oct.

Accurate prediction of protein 3D structure from amino acid sequence has long remained an open challenge in computational biology. Recently, the deep learning system AlphaFold2 has achieved dramatic improvements in protein structure prediction. In this lecture, we detail the components of the AlphaFold2 model and the training methodology used to enable robust structure prediction.
