**Project Plan Instructions: Data-Driven Life Sciences Course**

In this module, you will select a dataset from Kaggle under the Biology tag ([Kaggle Biology Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?tags=7100-Biology)) and propose an analysis plan to introduce an advanced AI method to analyze the data. This can be a method discussed during the course or from a recent AI paper. The analysis tasks may include extracting statistics, segmenting images, classification, or generating new data.

1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Work in pairs or individually to select a dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset is of good quality, manageable scale, and has well-structured labels.
   - Review the 'Code' tab under the dataset on Kaggle to understand what others have done with the data in notebooks.

2. **AI Method Selection**:
   - Choose an advanced AI method; aim for more recent methods if possible.
   - Look for available code to ease the implementation.
   - Utilize ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas and conduct some preliminary tests on the dataset to ensure feasibility.

3. **Analysis Plan**:
   - Detail how you intend to apply the chosen AI method to your dataset.
   - Discuss the expected outcomes and any potential challenges.

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Break down the steps necessary to carry out the analysis.
   - Highlight any resources or tools you plan to use.

5. **Evaluation Plan**:
   - Define metrics for evaluating your analysis.
   - Discuss how you will compare your results with other methods, if applicable.

6. **Project Timeline**:
   - Breakdown of tasks with deadlines leading up to the submission and presentation dates.

**Important Dates**:
- **11th October, 13:00-17:00**: Analysis Plan Discussion.
- **25th October, 08:00-13:00**: Project Presentation.

**Final Report Structure**:
- **Project Plan**:
  - Include the project plan that you submitted earlier.
- **Dataset Summary**:
  - Provide a summary of the selected dataset.
  - Discuss the data quality and any preprocessing steps taken.
- **Method Description**:
  - Describe the AI method you implemented.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Explain how you carried out the analysis.
- **Results**:
  - Present the results of your implementation.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Interpret the results and discuss any insights gained.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Conclude what your findings suggest.
  - Propose further improvements or future directions.
- **Discussion**:
  - Discuss the limitations and drawbacks of your work.
  - Adhere to the 10-rule for paper writing discussed during the seminars.

Ensure to submit your analysis plan for approval before starting, and feel free to reach out for guidance or suggestions throughout the project duration.
