**Project Plan Instructions: Data-Driven Life Sciences Course**

In this module, you will select a dataset from Kaggle under the Biology tag ([Kaggle Biology Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?tags=7100-Biology)) and propose an analysis plan to introduce an advanced AI method to analyze the data. This can be a method discussed during the course or from a recent AI paper. The analysis tasks may include extracting statistics, segmenting images, classification, or generating new data.

1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Work in pairs or individually to select a dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset is of good quality, manageable scale, and has well-structured labels.
   - Review the 'Code' tab under the dataset on Kaggle to understand what others have done with the data in notebooks.

2. **AI Method Selection**:
   - Choose an advanced AI method; aim for more recent methods if possible.
   - Look for available code to ease the implementation.
   - Utilize ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas and conduct some preliminary tests on the dataset to ensure feasibility.

3. **Analysis Plan**:
   - Detail how you intend to apply the chosen AI method to your dataset.
   - Discuss the expected outcomes and any potential challenges.

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Break down the steps necessary to carry out the analysis.
   - Highlight any resources or tools you plan to use.

5. **Evaluation Plan**:
   - Define metrics for evaluating your analysis.
   - Discuss how you will compare your results with other methods, if applicable.

6. **Project Timeline**:
   - Breakdown of tasks with deadlines leading up to the submission and presentation dates.

**Important Dates**:
- Finalize Project Plan: **11th October, 13:00-17:00, location: SciLifeLab, Solna (Room Gamma-3-Tesla-G3551)**
- ~~Project Presentation: 25th October, 08:00-13:00~~
- Project Presentation (Option 1): **Thursday 26th, 15:00-17:00 at SciLifeLab, Solna (Room Gamma-3-Tesla-G3551)**
- Project Presentation (Option 2): **Wednesday 1st, 9:00-12:00 at SciLifelab, Solna (Room Gamma-3-Tesla-G3551)**

**Accessing SciLifeLab**
Please note the following meeting locations will be at SciLifeLab, Sonla (Address: SciLifeLab, TomtebodavÃ¤gen 23, 171 65 Solna)

To access the building, you will need an access card. Please follow the instructions below to obtain an access card:

> The students will be able to pick up their access cards at the Service Desk located at the reception, opening hours are Mon-Fri 09:30-12:00. The student needs to show ID for pick up.

During the 3-4 weeks time until Nov. 1st, you can use the access card to come to SciLifeLab if you want to work on the project, and get advice from the course teacher.
