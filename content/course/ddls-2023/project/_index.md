For the final part of the course, you will select a dataset from Kaggle under the Biology tag ([Kaggle Biology Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?tags=7100-Biology)) or other dataset sources (e.g. [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se/search?itemTypes=3)), and propose an analysis plan to introduce an advanced AI method to analyze the data. This can be a method discussed during the course or from a recent AI paper. The analysis tasks will be decided by the dataset you selected, it may include extracting statistics, segmenting images, classification, or generating new data.

To work on the project, you can either work alone or find a partner. If you choose to work in pairs, you will need to select a dataset and two AI methods together, the project report should be written separately, with a clear division of work on different methods. The final oral presentation will be done together.

## Project Plan

Before starting the project, you will need to submit the preliminary plan via this [submission form](https://forms.gle/VfdP8Yf7mkFHhdv16) as soon as possible, before **Wednesday 11th October, 13:00**. The course teacher will monitor the submission and provide feedbacks via email. The sooner we finally the plan, the sooner you can start to work on the project.

During the meeting on 11th Oct. (at 13:00, [over zoom]( https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/69812177998)), we will discuss the plan individually or in pairs, the aim is to finalize the project plan so you can start to work on it.

The project plan (**submitted before Wednesday 11th, before 18:00**) should include the following:

1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Work in pairs or individually to select a dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset is of good quality, manageable scale, and has well-structured labels.
   - Review the 'Code' tab under the dataset on Kaggle to understand what others have done with the data in notebooks.

2. **AI Method Selection**:
   - Choose an advanced AI method; aim for more recent methods if possible.
   - Look for available code to ease the implementation.
   - Utilize ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas and conduct some preliminary tests on the dataset to ensure feasibility.

3. **Analysis Plan**:
   - Detail how you intend to apply the chosen AI method to your dataset.
   - Discuss the expected outcomes and any potential challenges.

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Break down the steps necessary to carry out the analysis.
   - Highlight any resources or tools you plan to use.

5. **Evaluation Plan**:
   - Define metrics for evaluating your analysis.
   - Discuss how you will compare your results with other methods, if applicable.

## Work on the Project

During the project, you are welcome to work at SciLifeLab, Solna (in the Lunch room on Gamma 2). Please see the [Accessing SciLifeLab](#accessing-scilifelab) section for more details.

There will be two meetings for progress update and feedbacks on **Wednesday 18th October, 15:00-16:00** and **Wednesday 25th October, 13:00-14:00** at SciLifeLab, Solna (Room Gamma-3-Tesla-G3551). Please come to SciLifeLab to meet each other and discuss the project progress, you can also use the opportunity to ask questions and get feedbacks.

While working on the project, please take notes and update your project report, save figures and results to slides which you will use for the final presentation.

## Final Report and Presentation

For complete the project, you need to submit a project report and present your project together.

There are two options for you to present your project:
 - option 1: **Thursday 26th, 15:00-17:00 at SciLifeLab, Solna (Room Gamma-3-Tesla-G3551)**
 - option 2: **Wednesday 1st, 9:00-12:00 at SciLifelab, Solna (Room Gamma-3-Tesla-G3551)**

Please choose one option according to your course schedule. If you work in pairs, be sure to present together.

For the project report, it should cover the following content, maximum 5 pages:

- **Project Plan**:
  - Include the project plan that you submitted earlier.
- **Dataset Summary**:
  - Provide a summary of the selected dataset.
  - Discuss the data quality and any preprocessing steps taken.
- **Method Description**:
  - Describe the AI method you implemented.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Explain how you carried out the analysis.
- **Results**:
  - Present the results of your implementation.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Interpret the results and discuss any insights gained.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Conclude what your findings suggest.
  - Propose further improvements or future directions.
- **Discussion**:
  - Discuss the limitations and drawbacks of your work.
  - Adhere to the 10-rule for paper writing discussed during the seminars.

Disregard which option you choose for the presentation, please submit the final report via this [submission form](https://forms.gle/VfdP8Yf7mkFHhdv16) before **Wednesday 1st November, 18:00**.

## Grading

Given that you have passed all the previous course modules, the final project report and presentation will be graded as A-F for master students, and P/F for PhD students. The grade of the project will be used as the final grade for the course.

To access the building, you will need an access card. Please follow the instructions below to obtain an access card:

> The students will be able to pick up their access cards at the Service Desk located at the reception, opening hours are Mon-Fri 09:30-12:00. The student needs to show ID for pick up.

During the 3-4 weeks time until Nov. 1st, you can use the access card to come to SciLifeLab if you want to work on the project and discuss with others (any time in Gamma 2 lunch room), and get advice from the course teacher (during the two progress update meeting, at Gamma 3 Tesla room).

If asked for the contact person, tell the reception that you are attending a course organized by Wei Ouyang.
