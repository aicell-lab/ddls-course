<!-- updated: 14.08.2024 -->
**Start date**: Week 41 (9th October 2024)

Join us at the **DDLS Hackathon** at **SciLifeLab in Solna**, where course participants will choose and collaborate on a range of projects provided by us. With the support of teaching assistants in a hands-on environment, groups will innovate and develop solutions in the dynamic field of data-driven life science.

The hackathon will take place from the **9th to the 11th of October 2024**. During this period, participants will select a dataset and apply the skills and knowledge gained during the course to create AI models, analyze the data, and produce meaningful insights. To enhance interactivity, all participants are invited to come to SciLifeLab in Solna for this three-day event. At the end of the hackathon, teams will present their achievements.

Everyone involved in the DDLS program, including PIs, affiliated PhD students, postdocs, and facility trainers, is welcome to join the code fair. Participants will form pairs or small groups of 2-3 people on-site to work on projects, exchange ideas and experiences, and engage in pair programming. This collaborative environment will foster innovation and provide a unique opportunity to apply the concepts learned throughout the course to real-world problems in data-driven life sciences.
