### Final Project

The final project allows students to showcase their learning by proposing their own dataset and project idea. This open-ended assignment encourages participants to explore topics of interest within data-driven life science and apply the skills gained throughout the course by yourself or in a pair of two student (at the same level, e.g. both are master students).

**Project Requirements**:
- Students are required to submit a proposal for approval before beginning their project.
- **Each group should submit only one proposal.**
- Proposals should reflect challenging and engaging work that integrates course content.

### Project Proposal Submission:

- Maximum of one page
- File format: PDF

**Structure:**

- Include your name or the two group member names (in case of a pair)
- Title of the project
- Dataset to be used and its source
    - make sure you have tested the data availability
    - make sure the data is suitable for the project idea
    - make sure the data is not too small or too big to be handled in the given time frame
- Abstract of the project, including motivation and course concepts to be applied
    - Include the motivation for the project
    - Describe the idea and the problem you want to solve
    - Explain how you plan to solve the problem (including the course concepts you will apply)
