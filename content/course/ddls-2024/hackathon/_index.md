### Hackathon

Join us at the **[DDLS Hackathon](https://training.scilifelab.se/events/data-driven-life-science-hackathon)**, a vibrant code festival for the SciLifeLab/DDLS community! This hackathon is part of the [2024 DDLS course](https://ddls.aicell.io/course/ddls-2024/) and participants will collaborate on their projects in the dynamic field of data-driven life science, supported by teaching assistants in a hands-on environment.

**Who Can Participate?**

The hackathon is open to **everyone** in the DDLS community, including PIs, PhD students, postdocs, facility experts/trainers, and anyone interested in data-driven life science. Participants can work on **any topic** of their choice.

We will also welcome the participation of the DDLS course participants, who will work on their final projects with their groups.

**Event Details**:

Hackathon participants will form small groups of 2-3 people on-site or online (determined during the hackathon) to work on projects, exchange ideas, and engage in pair programming. This collaborative environment fosters innovation and provides a unique opportunity to apply concepts to real-world problems.

DDLS course participants will have the opportunity to work on their [final projects](../final-project/) and interact with other participants.

**Benefits of Attending:**

- Hands-on experience with a data-driven life science project
- Networking opportunities with experts, researchers, and infrastructure specialists in the field, we will have a mix of participants from different backgrounds
- Social coding, pair programming, and group work
