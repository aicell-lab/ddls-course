### Hackathon

Join us at the **[DDLS Hackathon](https://training.scilifelab.se/events/data-driven-life-science-hackathon)**, a vibrant code festival for the SciLifeLab/DDLS community! This hackathon is part of the [2024 DDLS course](https://ddls.aicell.io/course/ddls-2024/) and participants will collaborate on their projects in the dynamic field of data-driven life science, supported by teaching assistants in a hands-on environment.

**Who Can Participate?**

Not only DDLS Course Participants, the hackathon is open to **everyone** in the DDLS community, including PIs, PhD students, postdocs, facility experts/trainers, and anyone interested in data-driven life science. Participants can work on **any topic** of their choice.

A note for DDLS couse participants: Participation **is not mandatory.**

**Event Details**:

DDLS course participants will have the opportunity to work on their [final projects](../final-project/) with their groups.
