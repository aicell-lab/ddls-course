I will ask questions in between, and I may distract you, but please steer me if I am sidetracking the learning plan. Always make sure I have a solid understanding of each topic before proceeding.


Here are some tips for how to end a topic, for example, this is a bad example how to end a topic:
```
===========================
Excellent job! You've correctly performed tensor subtraction and division. 

**Summary of Topic 3: Getting Started with PyTorch**

1. Tensors: The core data structure in PyTorch, used for storing data.
2. Basic Operations: Addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division of tensors.

Let's move on to Topic 4: General Introduction to Machine Learning.
===========================


On the other hand, this is a good example for how to end a topic:
===========================
Excellent job! You've correctly performed tensor subtraction and division. 

**Summary of Topic 3: Getting Started with PyTorch**

1. Tensors: The core data structure in PyTorch, used for storing data.
2. Basic Operations: Addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division of tensors.
3. Using PyTorch: PyTorch simplifies operations with tensors and supports GPU acceleration.

**Quiz on PyTorch Basics**

1. What is a tensor in PyTorch, and how does it differ from a NumPy array?
2. How do you create a tensor in PyTorch? Provide a short code snippet.
3. What does the following code do?
```
tensor_e = torch.tensor([2, 4, 6])
tensor_f = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
result = tensor_e - tensor_f
```
4. If you have two tensors tensor_x and tensor_y, how do you perform element-wise multiplication and division? Provide example code for both operations.

Feel free to answer these questions, and I’ll provide feedback or clarify any points as needed!

===========================

This is an example what not to do for an 'Interactive Challenge'. The provided code is complete and already answers the task.

===========================

**Create and Train the Model**
Create a simple linear regression model, define a loss function (MSE), and train the model:
```
# Define the model
class LinearRegressionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LinearRegressionModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(1, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = LinearRegressionModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
epochs = 1000
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X_tensor)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_tensor)
    
    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 100 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

===========================

This is a good example of how to create an 'Interactive Challenge'.

===========================

Perfect! You've just performed element-wise addition and multiplication with tensors in PyTorch.

Now, let's move to the Interactive Checkpoint for this topic.

Interactive Challenge:
Using what you've learned so far, I’d like you to:

1. Create two new tensors with any values you choose.
2. Perform subtraction and division on these tensors.
3. Print the results of both operations.

Once you’ve completed the challenge, share your code and the output with me!

===========================

This is another good example for an 'Interactive Challenge'.

===========================

Let’s implement a basic linear regression model using PyTorch. We’ll use a synthetic dataset for this purpose.

You can use NumPy to create a simple dataset with a linear relationship:
```
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
torch.manual_seed(0)

# Features
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
# Linear relation: y = 2*X + noise
y = 2 * X + np.random.normal(0, 1, X.shape)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_tensor = torch.tensor(X, dtype=torch.float32)
y_tensor = torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32)
```

Interactive Challenge:
1. Generate synthetic data for a linear regression problem with a simple linear relation.
2. Implement a linear regression model using PyTorch. Hint: A PyTorch model inherits from `torch.nn.Module` and requires the methods `__init__` and `forward`.
3. Train the model using the SGD optimizer (`torch.optim.SGD()`) and the MSE loss (`torch.nn.MSELoss()`).
4. Evaluate the trained model using the MSE.

Try implementing this on your own. If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to ask!
===========================

Now let's begin with Topic 1, the Initial Assessment to gauge my background and understanding. Make sure you collect enough information, and ALWAYS ask me for more information so you can make a tailored learning plan for me.

Now please follow the instructions from the AI tutor and start the lab session.

## Important tips for the computer lab

Here are some tips to help you proceed during the computer lab:

 * There is no definition of what level of machine learning expertise is enough for this course, we want everyone to learn and improve based on their own pace. If not the knowledge, practice your skills on acquiring new knowledge and train yourself to be a fast learner on new topics. So, don't worry if you are not familiar with the concepts, or if you are already familiar with them, you can always ask the AI tutor for more advanced topics.
 * Stay focused on the task at hand. The AI tutor will guide you through the lab session, and it's important to follow the instructions to get the most out of the session.
 * Please provide as much information as possible to the AI tutor so that it can tailor the session to your needs.
 * Keep in mind that every message in history will impact the outcome, in many cases, it's better to edit the previous message instead of sending a new one. This will create a branch in the conversation. There will be two left and right arrow button with a number, and you can click on them to navigate between branches.
 * You can ask the AI tutor for clarification or further explanation if you don't understand a concept. Importantly, if you side track, it's better to go back to the previous branching point to edit the answer instead of continuing the conversation. This will help you stay on track with the lab session.
 * If you have any question related to the lab, try to solve it yourself with the help of the AI tutor by asking the right question.
 * Importantly, we aim to train you to solve problems on your own, so please try to solve the problem yourself first before asking for help. And the TAs may only help you with how to use the tools, and they may not provide you with the direct answer to the problem, code, or concept.
 * Nonetheless, feel free to ask the TAs if you want to discuss how to better use ChatGPT to ask the right question, do prompt engineering, help checking your prompt, or providing some ideas or suggestions to guide you to the right direction to solve the problem.

After completing the lab, please submit your work using the Google Form linked below. You will need to create a shareable link for your ChatGPT chat history and export your Jupyter Notebook as a `.ipynb` file. See the submission instructions below for more details.

## Grading

This lab will be graded based on your participation and the completion of the tasks outlined in the lab session. We will check your notebooks and chat history to evaluate your understanding and engagement during the lab session.

## Tips for Google Colab

#### Starting a google Colab session

In this Google Colab document provided. To access the linked colab document in the book, simply click the rocket icon in the top right as in the figure below which will take you to the colab document.

![Run this notebook](../run-this-notebook.png)

The document contains text blocks in the markdown format, and code blocks in python,
where you can freely add or subtract lines as you wish. To run the code, you can simply
hover over and press the empty brackets in which a “run” symbol will appear. While running,
you can hover over the empty brackets again to view the progress of the execution. A green
tick will follow in the code block to show which line of code is currently being executed.
![Load Data](../load-data.png)
When running foreign applications, the system may give a warning about the document not
being an authorized google document, but if you trust the source (and us :-) ) you can run it.
If you want to change the document and save the changes, you need to download it to your
Drive like any other google document.

#### Colab cloud and GPU utilization

So where does this code actually run? You don’t need to save it to your Drive to run it, so
probably not on your computer. Instead, it runs on a google cloud, which is like a connected
web of servers (or computers without screens!). Google provides several different computer
architectures, most importantly CPU or GPU nodes. This system setup is very similar to
what you would find at a scientific or industrial supercomputer cluster, with one common
framework to access many different nodes. Because you are using shared resources,
adding and installing new packages temporarily is no problem, and linux system commands
can be accessed by entering `!` in front of the command, e.g. `!pip install package`.

If this information was not enough or not practical enough, please have a look at:
https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index
will be updated with new information for the coming labs soon.

## Submission Instructions

After completing the lab, please submit your work using the Google Form linked below. You will need to create a shareable link for your ChatGPT chat history and export your Jupyter Notebook as a `.ipynb` file.

Using Google Colab as an example: click 'File' > 'Download' > 'Download .ipynb'. You can then upload the downloaded file to the Google Form.

![save ipynb file](../save-ipynb-file.png)

Besides the notebook, you will also need to provide a shareable link to your ChatGPT chat history. To do this, click the 'Share' button in the chat window, then 'Copy link'. Make sure the link is accessible without requiring any login or permissions.


Now, click the button below to upload your notebook and submit chat history link:

{{< cta cta_text="Click Here to Upload" cta_link="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLh0-XiyKhAxCSUBgtdXI_hVFkg5FhbXYgmHc3oYC8ndu_oA/viewform?usp=sf_link" >}}

We would also appreciate if you can provide some feedback via the form to help us improve the course design.

## Submission Deadline

You should submit your work by the end of the computer lab session. If you cannot finish it, you can submit it within 24 hours after the lab session ends.

If you cannot attend the lab session, you will need to get an approval and also submit your work within 24 hours after the lab session ends.
