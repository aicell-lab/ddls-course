This week's lab is meant to catch you up with concepts and coding skills that you will need for the rest of the class.

You don't need any preparation for this lab, a chatgpt prompt will be distributed during the computer lab and you will be able to follow along.

After completing the lab, please export your Python notebook from Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook as a `.ipynb` file and upload it using the link below:
