After opening the notebook in Google Colab, save a personal copy to your Google Drive: **File** > **Save a copy in Drive**. You'll run and complete your tasks in this copy.

### Objective

In this lab, you will:

- Learn how to use **EvoBind**, which leverages **AlphaFold2** for protein structure prediction.

- Apply EvoBind to design a peptide binder.

### Important Notes

- **Hands-On Learning:** This lab emphasizes active participation. You'll need to carefully study and complete the code snippets provided in the notebook. Full solutions are not provided, so this is your chance to deepen your understanding.

- **Set Runtime to GPU:** Ensure your runtime is set to GPU: **Runtime** > **Change runtime type** > **Hardware accelerator** (set to GPU).

## Submission Instructions

After completing the notebook exercises:

1\. Export your notebook from Google Colab:

   - **File** > **Download** > **Download .ipynb**

2\. Submit the downloaded file using the provided submission form.
