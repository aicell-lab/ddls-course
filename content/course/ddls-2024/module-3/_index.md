A passionate bioinformatician focused on uncovering patterns in biological data through the analysis of sequencing data across various living systems.

**Title: Decoding Cell-Level Biology with scRNA-Seq Data**

In this lecture, you will gain insights into RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) methods, with a particular focus on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). We will briefly introduce sequencing techniques and highlight the differences between bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq.

The lecture will cover the scRNA-Seq workflow, including sample preparation, sequencing, data preprocessing, and result interpretation. Key topics such as cell clustering and trajectory inference will be discussed. An example of scRNA-Seq data analysis will be demonstrated to illustrate these concepts.

By the end of this lecture, attendees will have a solid understanding of scRNA-Seq techniques and their application in genomics research.

#### Speaker 2: Laura Carroll (DDLS Felow, September 11th, 2024; 10:00-11:00 CEST)

This session will discuss the impact of (meta)genomic sequencing in microbiology. It will cover bioinformatic approaches for pathogen surveillance and outbreak detection, and the development of phylodynamic models and machine learning techniques for microbial analysis.

**Computer Lab**: The lab will cover tools in bioinformatics and metagenomics data analysis with practical exercises, providing hands-on experience in applying these techniques to real-world datasets.
