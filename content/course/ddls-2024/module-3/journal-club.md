This week, please read the paper titled as "[Transfer learning enables predictions in network biology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06139-9)".

## Abstract

Mapping gene networks requires large amounts of transcriptomic data to learn the connections between genes, which impedes discoveries in settings with limited data, including rare diseases and diseases affecting clinically inaccessible tissues. Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30â€‰million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.

**Deadline**: Submit your PDF before the journal club session.

If you cannot attend the journal club session, please let the instructor know in advance. And you still need to submit your PDF before the session even if you cannot attend.
 
 ## Join the Journal Club

During the journal club, we will walk through the question sheet together. Everyone will be selected at random to answer one or more questions from the question sheet, and/or describe selected figures.
