[Click here to access the Google Colab notebook 2](https://). 

Access will be granted once the computer lab session begins.

After opening the notebook in Google Colab, save a personal copy to your Google Drive: **File** > **Save a copy in Drive**. You'll run and complete your tasks in this copy.

### Objective

In this lab, you will:

- Learn how to use **EvoBind**, which leverages **AlphaFold2** for designing novel peptide binders.

- Apply EvoBind to design your peptide binder.

### Important Notes

- **Set Runtime to GPU:** Ensure your runtime is set to GPU: **Runtime** > **Change runtime type** > **Hardware accelerator** (set to GPU).

- **Hands-On Learning:** This lab emphasizes active participation. You'll need to carefully study and complete the code snippets provided in the notebook. Full solutions are not provided, so this is your chance to deepen your understanding.

- **Time Management:** It’s OK to upload your work without finishing all tasks during the computer lab. Focus on learning from the exercises you complete, as the primary goal is to understand the key concepts as you work through the notebook.

## Submission Instructions

After completing the notebook exercises:

1\. Export your notebook from Google Colab:

   - **File** > **Download** > **Download .ipynb**

2\. Submit the downloaded file using the provided submission form.

## Submission Deadline

You should submit your work by the end of the computer lab session. If you cannot finish it, you can submit it within 24 hours after the lab session ends. So the deadline is Thursday, 12.09.2024, at 17:00 CEST.

If you cannot attend the lab session, you will need to get an approval and also submit your work within 24 hours after the lab session ends.
