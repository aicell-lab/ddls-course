**Title: Deep learning enabled image-driven scientific discovery**

Recent advancements in bioimage analysis, particularly leveraging deep learning techniques, are revolutionizing image-driven scientific discovery by enhancing the speed, accuracy and capacity to extract valuable insights and relationships from biological images. Their ability to uncover intricate patterns and seamlessly adapting to the increasing volume of experimental data holds promise for heuristic approaches in research. In this lecture, I will introduce basic concepts in deep learning, microscopy imaging and bioimage analysis as well as discuss with you the actual context in image driven scientific discovery and provide you a collection of resources to explore these techniques yourself. Additionally, I will briefly introduce the different collaborative tools developed together with colleagues to foster the accessibility and reproducibility of deep learning approaches.

**Title: Advances in Generative AI for Conditional Microscopy Cell Images**

In this lecture, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of recent advances in generative AI, large language models, and diffusion models, with a focus on creating conditional microscopy cell images for whole-cell modeling. We will delve into the challenges faced in generative AI and explore potential paths forward in data-driven life sciences.

By the end of this lecture, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of how generative AI can be applied to generate and manipulate microscopy cell images for whole-cell modeling, along with the current challenges and future directions in this exciting field.

<!-- TODO: needs to be updated -->
**Computer Lab**: The lab will provide hands-on experience with tools and techniques in bioimage analysis, including the use of deep learning models for processing and analyzing microscopy images.
