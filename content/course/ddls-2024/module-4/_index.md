#### Speaker 1: Wei Ouyang (DDLS Fellow, 8:00-9:00 CEST)

This module will introduce the basic concepts in recent advances in generative AI, large language models, and diffusion models, focusing on creating conditional microscopy cell images for whole-cell modeling. It will also cover challenges in generative AI and potential paths forward in data-driven life sciences.

Estibaliz completed her PhD in Mathematical Engineering in 2021 and since then, she is an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Optical Cell Biology Group of Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência in Portugal. Her research focuses on contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques, Artificial Intelligence and live-cell microscopy imaging. She actively contributes to the dissemination and accessibility of these technologies within the deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, the Cell Tracking Challenge, DL4MicEverywhere and the BioImage Model Zoo projects. Now more about her [here]{https://henriqueslab.org/pages/egdmariscal}.

**Title: Deep learning enabled image-driven scientific discovery**

Recent advancements in bioimage analysis, particularly leveraging deep learning techniques, are revolutionizing image-driven scientific discovery by enhancing the speed, accuracy and capacity to extract valuable insights and relationships from biological images. Their ability to uncover intricate patterns and seamlessly adapting to the increasing volume of experimental data holds promise for heuristic approaches in research. In this lecture, I will introduce basic concepts in deep learning, microscopy imaging and bioimage analysis as well as discuss with you the actual context in image driven scientific discovery and provide you a collection of resources to explore these techniques yourself. Additionally, I will briefly introduce the different collaborative tools developed together with colleagues to foster the accessibility and reproducibility of deep learning approaches.
