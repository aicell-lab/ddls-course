This week, please read the paper titled as "[The multimodality cell segmentation challenge: toward universal solutions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02233-6)".

## Abstract

Cell segmentation is a critical step for quantitative single-cell analysis in microscopy images. Existing cell segmentation methods are often tailored to specific modalities or require manual interventions to specify hyper-parameters in different experimental settings. Here, we present a multimodality cell segmentation benchmark, comprising more than 1,500 labeled images derived from more than 50 diverse biological experiments. The top participants developed a Transformer-based deep-learning algorithm that not only exceeds existing methods but can also be applied to diverse microscopy images across imaging platforms and tissue types without manual parameter adjustments. This benchmark and the improved algorithm offer promising avenues for more accurate and versatile cell analysis in microscopy imaging.

## Assignment

- Read the paper and use the [Question Sheet](/question-sheet/) which contains a set of questions designed to guide your reading and understanding.
- Fill out your question sheet and submit before the journal club.
- Be ready to discuss in the journal club.

**Deadline**: Submit your PDF before the journal club session.

If you cannot attend the journal club session, please let the instructor know in advance. And you still need to submit your PDF before the session even if you cannot attend.
 
 ## Join the Journal Club

During the journal club, we will walk through the question sheet together. Everyone will be selected at random to answer one or more questions from the question sheet, and/or describe selected figures.
