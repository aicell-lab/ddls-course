Welcome to the practical session of Module 4, created by lecturer [Estibaliz Gómez de Mariscal](https://esgomezm.github.io/) and has been further modified by Dr. Wei Ouyang, along with teaching assistants Songtao Cheng and Nils Mechtel. In this lab, you'll learn some useful skills from the following Google Colab notebooks.

[Notebook: U-Net for Cell Segmentation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19HdkUnC3zAJRL1qacBZsjGO0lfBoePZx?usp=sharing). 

**Access will only be granted after the computer lab session begins.**

After opening the notebooks in Google Colab, save a personal copy to your Google Drive: **File** > **Save a copy in Drive**. You'll run and complete your tasks in this copy.

### Objective

In this lab, you will:

-   Implement and train a U-Net model for cell segmentation using phase-contrast microscopy images.

-   Understand the architecture of U-Net and its application in biomedical image segmentation.

-   Experiment with different hyperparameters to observe their effects on model performance.


### Important Notes

- **Set Runtime to GPU:** Ensure your runtime is set to GPU: **Runtime** > **Change runtime type** > **Hardware accelerator** (set to GPU).

- **Hands-On Learning:** This lab emphasizes active participation. You'll need to carefully study and complete the code snippets provided in the notebooks. Full solutions are not provided, so this is your chance to deepen your understanding.

- **Time Management:** It’s OK to upload your work without finishing all tasks during the computer lab. Focus on learning from the exercises you complete, as the primary goal is to understand the key concepts as you work through the notebooks.

## Submission Instructions

After completing the notebooks exercises:

1\. Export your notebooks from Google Colab:

   - **File** > **Download** > **Download .ipynb**

2\. Submit the downloaded files using the provided submission form.

## Submission Deadline

You should submit your work by the end of the computer lab session. If you cannot finish it, you can submit it within 24 hours after the lab session ends. So the deadline is Thursday, 19.09.2024, at 17:00 CEST.

If you cannot attend the lab session, you will need to get an approval and also submit your work within 24 hours after the lab session ends.
