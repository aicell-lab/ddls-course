This week, please read the paper titled as "[Autonomous chemical research with large language models](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06792-0)".

## Abstract

Transformer-based large language models are making significant strides in various fields, such as natural language processing, biology, chemistry and computer programming. Here, we show the development and capabilities of Coscientist, an artificial intelligence system driven by GPT-4 that autonomously designs, plans and performs complex experiments by incorporating large language models empowered by tools such as internet and documentation search, code execution and experimental automation. Coscientist showcases its potential for accelerating research across six diverse tasks, including the successful reaction optimization of palladium-catalysed cross-couplings, while exhibiting advanced capabilities for (semi-)autonomous experimental design and execution. Our findings demonstrate the versatility, efficacy and explainability of artificial intelligence systems like Coscientist in advancing research.

## Assignment

- Read the paper and use the [Question Sheet](/question-sheet/) which contains a set of questions designed to guide your reading and understanding.
- Fill out your question sheet and submit before the journal club.
- Be ready to discuss in the journal club.

**Deadline**: Submit your PDF before the journal club session.

If you cannot attend the journal club session, please let the instructor know in advance. And you still need to submit your PDF before the session even if you cannot attend.
 
 ## Join the Journal Club

During the journal club, we will walk through the question sheet together. Everyone will be selected at random to answer one or more questions from the question sheet, and/or describe selected figures.
