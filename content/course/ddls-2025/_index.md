Welcome to the 2025 Data-Driven Life Sciences (DDLS) course. Across six modules you will explore how data science and AI enable discovery in proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, molecular simulations, imaging, microbiology, and systems/precision medicine.

Guest lecturers (DDLS Fellows, SciLifeLab Fellows, and SciLifeLab facility trainers) present real data, methods, and models underpinning current biological research. The course is open to all Master‚Äôs and PhD students as well as other interested participants.


## Registration

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course you will be able to:

- Describe the field of data-driven life sciences
- Summarize major application areas and their data types
- Give examples of typical analysis workflows
- Apply core statistical and machine learning methods to biological datasets
- Formulate simple models of biological phenomena
- Employ AI tools/agents to support reasoning, problem solving, and exploration
- Critically evaluate and responsibly integrate AI outputs into analyses
- Collaborate effectively with AI-assisted tools to enhance research productivity
- Present and review scientific literature
- Practice sound data management (collection, handling, sharing, analysis)
- Reflect on limitations, biases, risks, and ethical considerations of AI
- Reflect on broader ethical implications of data-driven life sciences

## Course Format and Credits

The course consists of six required modules. Each module spans one week with three core sessions: lecture(s) on Tuesday, a hands‚Äëon computer lab on Wednesday ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) notebooks), and a journal club on Friday. Completing all modules yields 7.5 ECTS.

## Modules and Certification

Both the computer lab and the journal club are mandatory and pass/fail assessed.

- Labs: You receive a Jupyter notebook with guided exercises. Work in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), discuss during the session, and submit your completed notebook for evaluation.
- Journal club: You address a standard question set each week while discussing the assigned paper. Participation and contributions are graded.

Final project: Pairs (Master‚Äôs) or individual (PhD) projects culminate in a project report (all) and an oral presentation (Master‚Äôs only; PhD optional). Peer assessment precedes examiner grading.

To receive ECTS credits or a certificate of participation you must actively attend and engage in all required sessions of each selected module.

## Self-Directed Learning

A core objective is to strengthen your ability to ‚Äúlearn how to learn.‚Äù You are encouraged to use modern AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to explore concepts, draft code, and critique analyses‚Äîwhile remaining accountable for verifying outputs, documenting usage, and recognizing limitations and biases. This approach is integral to both labs and journal clubs.
