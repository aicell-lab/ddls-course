# ðŸ“˜ Journal Club Instructions (2025)

This week, we will introduce how the rest of the journal clubs will look.

---

## 1. How Scientific Papers Are Structured

We will begin by reading and discussing **[Ten Simple Rules for Structuring Papers (PLOS Comp Biol, 2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)**.

This paper is not a research article itself, but a guide on how scientific papers are written and structured. It will help you understand:

* Why scientific papers follow the IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)
* How titles, abstracts, and figures are designed to communicate clearly
* The importance of logical flow and storytelling in scientific writing

By working through this article, you will learn how to **navigate research papers systematically** â€” a skill that will support every future journal club.

---

## 2. The Reflection Sheet

Every week, we will use the **[Critical Reading & Reflection Sheet for Journal Club Papers](/question-sheet-v2/)**.

This sheet is designed for the AI era:

* You can use tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, ScholarAI, or Gemini CLI to help summarize sections
* But you must **critically evaluate and refine AI outputs**, noting where they fail or oversimplify
* Each section includes both summary prompts (to align everyone) and critical prompts (to push deeper thinking)

---

## 3. Weekly Journal Club Format

* **Assigned Paper**: Each week you will be given a scientific article to read (link provided in advance).
* **Preparation**: Complete the reflection sheet before class.
* **In Class**:

  * Students will be randomly selected to answer questions from the sheet
  * Some will explain or critique figures
  * We will compare and discuss different interpretations
* **Participation & Grading**: Based on preparation, clarity, critical engagement, and contributions to discussion.

---

## 4. Why This Matters

Scientific papers remain the **currency of science**. In todayâ€™s AI era, where many texts are produced or polished by generative tools, it is even more important to train your ability to:

* Recognize assumptions and biases
* Interpret data and figures rigorously
* Identify overstatements and limitations
* Think independently and critically

The journal club is designed to be your **training ground** for these skills.
