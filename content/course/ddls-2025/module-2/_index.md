Estibaliz Gómez de Mariscal completed her PhD in Mathematical Engineering in 2021 and is currently an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow in the Optical Cell Biology Group at Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica António Xavier (ITQB NOVA), NOVA University of Lisbon, Portugal. Her research focuses on contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques, artificial intelligence, and live-cell microscopy imaging. She actively contributes to the dissemination and accessibility of these technologies within the deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, the Cell Tracking Challenge, DL4MicEverywhere, and the BioImage Model Zoo projects.

**Title: Deep learning enabled image-driven scientific discovery**

Recent advancements in bioimage analysis, particularly leveraging deep learning techniques, are revolutionizing image-driven scientific discovery by enhancing the speed, accuracy and capacity to extract valuable insights and relationships from biological images. Their ability to uncover intricate patterns and seamlessly adapting to the increasing volume of experimental data holds promise for heuristic approaches in research. In this lecture, I will introduce basic concepts in deep learning, microscopy imaging and bioimage analysis as well as discuss with you the actual context in image driven scientific discovery and provide you a collection of resources to explore these techniques yourself. Additionally, I will briefly introduce the different collaborative tools developed together with colleagues to foster the accessibility and reproducibility of deep learning approaches.
