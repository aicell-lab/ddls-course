This week, please read the paper titled as "[One-shot design of functional protein binders with BindCraft](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09429-6)".

## Abstract

Protein--protein interactions are at the core of all key biological processes. However, the complexity of the structural features that determine protein--protein interactions makes their design challenging. Here we present BindCraft, an open-source and automated pipeline for de novo protein binder design with experimental success rates of 10--100%. BindCraft leverages the weights of AlphaFold2 (ref.Â [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09429-6#ref-CR1 "Jumper, J. et al. Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold. Nature 596, 583--589 (2021).")) to generate binders with nanomolar affinity without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR--Cas9. We showcase the functional and therapeutic potential of designed binders by reducing IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples, modulating Cas9 gene editing activity and reducing the cytotoxicity of a foodborne bacterial enterotoxin. Last, we use cell-surface-receptor-specific binders to redirect adeno-associated virus capsids for targeted gene delivery. This work represents a significant advancement towards a 'one design-one binder' approach in computational design, with immense potential in therapeutics, diagnostics and biotechnology.
