Module 4 Computer Lab: Single-Cell RNA-Seq of COVID vs Controls

üåç Introduction
===============

In this lab, you will explore **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data** from patients with COVID compared to healthy controls. The main goal is to **identify gene expression differences at the single-cell level** between these groups.

You will perform a standard scRNASeq analysis using **Scanpy** in a Jupyter notebook, followed by repackaging the workflow into **MCP tools** and orchestrating it with the **Gemini CLI**.

üß™ Data Description
-------------------

- **Samples:** 4 patients with COVID and 4 healthy controls  
- **Cells:** Each sample has been subsampled to ~1500 cells

This dataset is small enough to run quickly during class, but still captures the essential features of a real scRNASeq study.


### Launch the Course Starter Notebook

#### Open the Module 4 starter notebook in Google Colab:

[<img style="display: inline" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aicell-lab/ddls-course/blob/main/static/notebooks/ddls-2025-module-4-computer-lab-scRNASeq.ipynb)

Notes:
- Runtime can be CPU; GPU is not necessary.
- You can run a cell with Shift+Enter.


**Alternative option (if VS Code in Colab does not work for you):**

If the VS Code-in-Colab setup fails or you prefer a different setup, please try to setup a google colab local runtime by following the¬†[instructions here](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html). You may need to download and setup Docker locally, then run a docker image.

Part I ‚Äî Classic scRNASeq Workflow in Jupyter
=============================================

In this section, you will use the notebook like a bioinformatician at the bench‚Äîrunning cells step by step to build an analysis using Scanpy.

### Work on your notebook

You‚Äôll follow a standard Scanpy pipeline: load the .h5ad dataset with metadata, run QC (including doublet detection and optional cell-cycle regression), normalize and select HVGs, integrate batches, embed (PCA/UMAP), cluster (Leiden).

At the end of Part I, you will have completed a basic scRNASeq pipeline using Scanpy inside Jupyter.

üß© Part II ‚Äî Building an AI Agent for Differential Gene Expression with MCP Tools
===================================================

### Why Part II?

In Part I, you explored a typical single-cell RNA-seq workflow step by step.
Now we move from **manual analysis** to **system design**: you will build a set of MCP tools, describe them in a `GEMINI.md` file, and let an AI agent (via the Gemini CLI) use these tools to perform a real biological task.

This teaches you how to **design workflows that an AI can reason about and execute automatically**.

---

### Setting up

For this part, we will:

* Start a **VS Code Tunnel** from the current notebook (environment already has all required packages installed).
* Continue the work inside VS Code, where you will develop MCP tools and interact with the Gemini CLI agent.

---

### What is MCP?

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) lets you wrap analysis steps as **tools** that an AI agent can call.

* Each tool has a clear **name, input, and output**.
* The agent can decide how to combine tools to solve a task.
* Instead of one long script, you provide **modular building blocks** that the AI can orchestrate.

Think of it as teaching the agent how to **press the right buttons in your analysis pipeline**.

---

### Task: Differential Gene Expression (DGE)

Now that we have preprocessed our PBMC dataset (Covid vs Control) in Part I, we will analyze **Differential Gene Expression**.

DGE in scRNA-seq is used to:

* Identify **gene markers** that distinguish cell populations.
* Identify **differentially regulated genes across conditions** (Covid vs Control).

**Your agent should be able to:**

1. Load the processed AnnData file.
2. Select a cluster or cell type.
3. Compare gene expression between **Covid and Control** cells within that cluster.
4. Run DGE tests (parametric and non-parametric):

   * *t-test*
   * *Wilcoxon rank-sum*
   * (Optionally: *logreg*)
5. Compare results between the tests.
6. Visualize the results (volcano, dotplot, violin, UMAP overlays).
7. Extend the comparison:

   * Between clusters (marker discovery)
   * Between conditions (Covid vs Control)
   * Between samples (consistency check)
8. Summarize results in a short report.

üìå **Hint:** By default, Scanpy uses `.raw` in AnnData for DGE; this can be changed with `use_raw=False`. The dataset contains >19,000 genes after filtering.

---

### Step 1: Build MCP Tools

Now to allow the AI agent to perform the task, you need to build a set of MCP tools. A minimal MCP server template is provided in the starter notebook.

Minimal MCP server pattern (example):

```bash
pip install mcp
```

```python
from typing import Any, Dict
from datetime import datetime
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("sc-mcp")

@mcp.tool("current_time")
def current_time() -> Dict[str, Any]:
   current_timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
   return {"current_time": current_timestamp}


if __name__ == "__main__":
   # Run as an MCP stdio server (no prints to stdout!)
   mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```
You can refer to full documentation to [MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
This skeleton demonstrates the pattern only. In your real server, use an MCP library that implements the protocol and wire real functions that call Scanpy.

Suggested tools for this task are (you may adjust, add, or remove):

* `load_anndata(path)` ‚Äì load dataset
* `subset_cells(query)` ‚Äì select cluster or type
* `check_group_sizes(groupby="condition")` ‚Äì confirm enough cells per group
* `run_dge(groupby, case, ref, method)` ‚Äì perform test
* `plot_volcano(dge_results)` ‚Äì visualize top DEGs
* `plot_umap(genes)` ‚Äì show expression on UMAP
* `compare_tests(results1, results2)` ‚Äì overlap between methods
* `save_table(results)` ‚Äì export DEG table
* `generate_report(dge_results, plots)` ‚Äì assemble Markdown report

üìå Write **clear documentation** for each tool (inputs, outputs, usage). This is what enables the AI agent to reason correctly.

### 3. Wire the server into Gemini CLI

Create or edit `~/.gemini/settings.json` and add an `mcpServers` entry like this:

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "sc-mcp": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/conda/envs/sc-mcp/bin/python",
         "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/sc_mcp_server.py"],
         "env": {
            "SC_MCP_WORKDIR": "/FULL/PATH/TO/work"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Tips: Gemini CLI discovers MCP servers from this file; use `/mcp` in the chat to list available tools.

---

### Step 2: Write `GEMINI.md`

This file tells the AI agent:

* **Context**: Covid PBMC dataset, processed and clustered in Part I.
* **Goal**: Perform DGE analysis to identify marker genes and condition-specific genes.
* **Tools**: list your MCP tools, with descriptions.
* **Plan**: outline how the agent should use them (load ‚Üí subset ‚Üí DGE ‚Üí visualize ‚Üí report).
* **Instructions**: check group sizes, compare methods, include at least one visualization.
* **Important Note:** Paste path to your conda environment in GEMINI.md to ensure Gemini installs packages and runs scripts in the correct Python environment. It's because the settings.json file assigns a Python environment to the `mcp` tool specifically, not to Gemini in general.
* **Deliverables**:

  * Top differentially expressed genes (table)
  * At least one plot (volcano, dotplot, or violin)
  * A short interpretation (2‚Äì3 sentences in your own words ‚Äî **add your own salt!**)

---

### Step 3: Run Gemini CLI Agent

* Launch the Gemini CLI agent with your `GEMINI.md`.
* Interact by specifying parameters (e.g., "analyze CD14+ monocytes, compare Covid vs Control").
* The agent will call your MCP tools step by step.

---

### Step 4: Generate the Report

Finally, use the agent to produce a **Markdown report** `REPORT.md` file that includes:

* Which cluster you analyzed
* A table of top DEGs with statistics
* At least one visualization
* A short interpretation of the results in **your own words**

* * * * *
