Avlant Nilsson is Assistant Professor in the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology at Karolinska Institutet, where he leads a research group focused on **deep learning models of cancer mechanisms**. He obtained his PhD in Systems Biology from Chalmers University of Technology (2014–2019), after earlier degrees in Biological Engineering and Engineering Physics, and most recently completed a postdoctoral position at MIT (2019–2023). His work involves developing interpretable deep learning methods constrained by known biomolecular interactions to analyze large-scale omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and perturbation data, with goals that include revealing drug targets, biomarkers, resistance mechanisms, and modeling tumor microenvironment interactions.
