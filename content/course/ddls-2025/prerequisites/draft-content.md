Welcome to the Data-driven Life Sciences 2025 course, where you will explore the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and life sciences to drive innovation and discovery. This fully online course culminates in an in-person hackathon, fostering a vibrant community that gathers DDLS and SciLifeLab members.

The 6 modules aim to introduce learners to computer-driven life sciences, covering key application areas in data-driven life sciences. Guest lecturers (DDLS Fellows, SciLifeLab fellows, and facility training providers) will teach cutting-edge topics in image analysis, protein structure prediction, genomics, precision medicine, and microbial research.

**New in 2025**: As a unique pedagogical approach, students will progressively build AI agents throughout the course as a hands-on method to consolidate their understanding of computational methods and tools in each domain.

The course is open to **all master's, PhD students and anyone interested in Sweden**.

**Registration will open in Spring 2025!**

## What's New in 2025: Hands-on Learning with AI Agents

This year's course introduces an innovative pedagogical approach to deepen learning:

- **Progressive AI Agent Development**: Build agents as a practical way to consolidate your understanding of each week's methods
- **Tool Integration**: Each week, equip your agent with new computational tools and domain knowledge  
- **Method Consolidation**: Use agent development to wrap and apply the computational methods you learn
- **Practical Application**: Agents serve as a hands-on platform to practice and integrate course concepts
- **Knowledge Integration**: Systematically build a comprehensive toolkit across all life science domains

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Describe the field of data-driven life sciences and key application areas
- Apply statistical and machine learning methods to diverse biological datasets
- Understand and implement computational approaches for image analysis, structural biology, genomics, precision medicine, and microbiology
- Develop proficiency in modern AI and machine learning frameworks
- Formulate computational models of biological phenomena
- Present and review scientific literature in computer-driven life sciences
- Reflect on the ethical implications of AI and data science in life sciences research
- Practice responsible development and deployment of computational tools

## Course Format and Credits

The course consists of 6 modules: a foundational module and 5 specialized modules. Each module is a stand-alone short-form course with 3 sessions per module. Completing all 6 modules earns a total of 7.5 ECTS.

## Modules and Certification

Each course module contains 3 main activities:

- **Tuesday Lecture**: Background information and current research in the week's life science domain
- **Wednesday Computer Lab**: Hands-on exploration of computational methods and tools, with AI agent development as a consolidation exercise
- **Friday Journal Club**: Collective discussion of cutting-edge research papers, with random presentation assignments

Both the computer lab and journal club are mandatory and graded activities!

- **Labs**: Learn and practice computational methods using Python in Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab). Each week, enhance your AI agent with new tools and knowledge as a way to consolidate your learning. Submit your analysis results and agent enhancements.

- **Journal Club**: Participate in discussions about recent research in the week's domain. Be prepared to present sections of assigned papers when randomly selected.

In the final project week/hackathon, participants will apply their accumulated knowledge and tools to real research challenges, working in pairs (Master's students) or individually (PhD students), followed by oral presentations.
