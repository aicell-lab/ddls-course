We are thrilled to announce that this year's Data-Driven Life Sciences (DDLS) course has seen an overwhelming response, with over 90 participants signing up for at least one module. In Module 1, we introduced the foundational concepts of data-driven life sciences, covering topics such as the data scale in life sciences, AI's role in data processing, the data cycle, FAIR data principles, and the exciting realm of generative AI. A significant focus was placed on prompt engineering in ChatGPT, highlighting its power and potential in advancing research and learning.

As a course that aims to teach advanced AI in life sciences, we fully embrace the practice of using AI in education. ChatGPT has become an integral component of this course, representing a complete paradigm shift in modern teaching. By integrating AI, we are changing the way knowledge is accessed and learned, empowering students to take charge of their educational journey.

#### A Revolutionary Approach to Learning

One of the highlights of Module 1 was the computer lab, where we designed an AI tutor—a ChatGPT prompt tailored to provide a structured, adaptive learning experience. This AI tutor is designed to cater to different student backgrounds, guiding them step by step through interactive challenges and coding practices at their own pace. This learner-centered approach not only makes the experience more inclusive but also enhances learning efficiency. It’s a shining example of how AI can be harnessed to create a more personalized and effective educational experience.

#### Exceptional Feedback from Students

During the first module, approximately 60 students submitted their computer lab notebooks along with chat histories that documented their interactions with ChatGPT. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback, with students expressing excitement and appreciation for this innovative learning approach. Here are a few examples of the feedback we received:

- *"It was awesome. Learning from ChatGPT is actually fun. I will redo the same process again and see how many new things I can learn."*
- *"The course is very interesting, however, ChatGPT restricted me from continuing with Topic 9 and 10. It showed that I have used it many times from yesterday until today, unless I create a new topic."*
- *"The computer lab was a bit difficult for me towards the end topics as it got a bit complex for a beginner in Python. However, it was nice to learn something new, which is what I continue to look forward to in this course."*
- *"Great prompt design to create the virtual tutor. It was easy to follow and well-structured."*

#### Addressing Feedback and Moving Forward

While the feedback has been largely positive, we also received some valuable suggestions and identified areas for improvement:

- **Message Limits in ChatGPT:** Some students encountered issues with ChatGPT's message limits, which disrupted their workflow. We suggest trying different accounts or splitting work into multiple sessions to mitigate this issue.
- **Pacing and Complexity:** A few students felt that the course started slowly and then accelerated too quickly. We encourage students to actively engage with ChatGPT to adjust the pace according to their comfort level.
- **Technical Challenges:** There were some challenges related to library/package mismatches in Google Colab, leading to troubleshooting efforts. These issues are part of the learning process, and students are encouraged to reach out for assistance when needed.
- **Request for Advance Materials:** Some students expressed a desire to receive course materials for upcoming modules in advance. While we understand this request, we believe that following the structured progression of the course helps ensure a deeper understanding of the content.

Overall, the feedback has been incredibly encouraging, and we are committed to refining the course to make it even more impactful. We are excited about the journey ahead and look forward to continuing this transformative experience together.

#### The Importance of Responsible AI Use

As we integrate AI into our educational practices, it is essential to use these tools responsibly. Generative AI like ChatGPT is a powerful asset, but it also comes with challenges such as potential misinformation, biases, and the risk of over-reliance on AI-generated content. To ensure that AI enhances rather than detracts from your learning experience, we encourage all students to be vigilant, critically evaluate AI-generated outputs, and always verify information against trusted sources.

#### Join Us on This Exciting Journey

The DDLS course represents a groundbreaking shift in how we approach education in the life sciences. By embracing AI, we are not only enhancing the learning experience but also paving the way for future innovations in the field. We encourage all students and community members to engage with the course, share their experiences, and be part of this exciting journey.
