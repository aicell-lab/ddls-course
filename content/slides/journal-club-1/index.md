-----
## Rule 1: Focus on a Central Contribution
* Your paper should have one main message.
* The title is crucial; it sets the stage and keeps your paper focused.
* Strive for a balance: Your contribution should be as simple as data and logic allow.
-----
## Rule 2: Write for a General Audience
* You're an expert, but your readers may not be.
* Use clear language and avoid jargon.
* Keep in mind human cognitive limitations.

-----

## Rule 3: Use the C-C-C Scheme
* Context-Content-Conclusion
* Serves patient readers who seek thorough understanding.
* Works on multiple scales: whole paper, paragraphs.

-----

## Rule 4: Optimize Logical Flow
* Avoid zig-zag; each subject should be covered once.
* Use parallelism to streamline the reader's cognitive load.

-----
## Rule 5: Tell a Complete Story in the Abstract
* Context, Content, Conclusion: The C-C-C elements of a successful abstract.
* Each section serves a distinct purpose: set the stage, summarize results, interpret outcomes.
* Avoid common mistake of presenting results too early.
* Iterate and refine to make results fill the gap seamlessly.

-----

## Rule 6: Communicate Why the Paper Matters in the Introduction
* Highlight the gap in current knowledge.
* Build the introduction progressively from field gap to subfield gap.
* The last paragraph summarizes the results to fill the gap.
* Aligns the reader's expectation for the paper's value.

-----

## Rule 7: Deliver Results as a Sequence of Statements
* Logical flow of statements supported by figures.
* Use paragraph structure to pose a question and provide an answer.
* Each paragraph's conclusion builds upon the previous, creating a chain of logic.

-----

## Rule 8: Discuss How the Gap Was Filled
* Recapitulate results, discuss limitations, and future directions.
* First paragraph summarizes key findings.
* Subsequent paragraphs evaluate weaknesses and strengths.
* Culminates in discussing the paper's impact on the field.

-----

## Rule 9: Allocate Time Where It Matters
* Prioritize Title, Abstract, and Figures.
* Outlining helps in planning text efficiently.
* Formalize the logical structure for better time management.

-----

## Rule 10: Get Feedback to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle the Story
* Writing as an optimization problem.
* Don't get too attached to your text; be ready to rewrite.
* Use feedback to refine the story, outline, and sentences.
