    "\n",
    "Welcome to the practical session of [Data-Driven Life Sciences course module 6](https://ddls.aicell.io/course/ddls-2025/module-6/lab/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore **automating scientific discovery and AI agents**, learning how to design, build, and evaluate agentic workflows that plan experiments, orchestrate tools and data pipelines, and interface with lab automation. You'll work hands-on with the Opentrons API for laboratory robotics simulation and develop AI agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that can autonomously design and execute experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Lab Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a **virtual laboratory** equipped with automated liquid handling robots to simulate real wetlab operations. Our primary tool is the **Opentrons Flex**, a state-of-the-art liquid handling robot that can perform precise pipetting, sample preparation, and protocol execution. The ultimate goal is to develop **AI agents that can autonomously design and control wetlab operations**, bridging the gap between computational intelligence and physical laboratory automation.\n",

    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- **Master Opentrons API**: Write and simulate robotic pipetting protocols\n",
    "- **Build MCP Tools**: Create remote-accessible tools using the Hypha platform  \n",
    "- **Work with AI Agents**: Configure Gemini CLI to design experiments autonomously\n",
    "- **Bridge Theory & Practice**: Apply coding concepts to real laboratory automation\n",

    "- **Gabriel Reder** (Cambridge University): Accelerating laboratory scientific discovery with AI, exploring how generative AI and large language models can automate repetitive tasks in biological research\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use cutting-edge concepts including lab automation robotics, Hypha for distributed computing, and MCP tools to connect AI agents with laboratory equipment, transforming how experimental science is conducted.\n",

So column 1 will contain the sample, column 2 will contain the sample diluted at 1:10, column 3 will be another 1:10 dilution (so 1:100 from the original sample) etc. You have the following working parameters for the protocol:\n",

    "In previous exercises you have worked with Gemini CLI and even built your own MCP tools. Each tool was designed for a specific purpose, for example, one tool to move a pipette, another to measure liquid, etc. This time, we take a different approach: instead of many small tools, you will get **one powerful coding agent**.\n",

    "A coding agent is an AI assistant that can write and run code step by step while remembering the current state. This means it can share the same Python environment across multiple calls. For example, if you define a variable or create a function, the agent can use it again later without redefining it. This is very different from traditional one-shot tools, which start from scratch each time.\n",
