    "In this lab, you will explore **automating scientific discovery and AI agents**, learning how to design, build, and evaluate agentic workflows that plan experiments, orchestrate tools and data pipelines, and interface with lab automation. You'll work hands-on with the Opentrons API for laboratory robotics simulation and develop AI agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that can autonomously design and execute experiments.\n",

    "In previous exercises you have worked with Gemini CLI and even built your own MCP tools. Each tool was designed for a specific purpose, for example, one tool to move a pipette, another to measure liquid, etc. This time, we take a different approach: instead of many small tools, you will get **one powerful coding agent**.\n",

    "A coding agent is an AI assistant that can write and run code step by step while remembering the current state. This means it can share the same Python context across multiple calls.

This is very different from traditional one-shot tools, which start from scratch each time.\n",
